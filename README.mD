<h1>Building a Simple CLI Tool with Golang</h1>

We are going to create a command line tool which counts the character, words or line in a file.


This project processes:

<ul>
<li>Getting a file name from command line. </li>
<li>Opening the file for reading. </li>
<li>Reading the contents of the file. </li>
<li>Count the lines, words and bytes. </li>
<li>Display the results.</li>
<ul>

<h3>To use the implemented commands:</h3>
<ul>
<li>-row to get the number of rows.
<li>-word to get the number of words.
<li>-char to get the number of characters.
</ul>
